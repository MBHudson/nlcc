# NLCC Resource Repository 
### To download this whole repository into your Linux environment, use the command string (without quotes) "git clone https://github.com/MBHudson/nlcc.git" in your terminal. 
### This will create a directory called “nlcc”, and as we’ve learned you can then move to that directory by using the “cd” command with the argument “nlcc”. EX: “cd nlcc” or “cd /nlcc/”
